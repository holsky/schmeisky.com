Every craftsman needs their toolbelt. This is mine:

  * Sublime Text 3
      - Plugins: Packacke Control, SublimeLinter, LatexTools
      - I use this for everything
  * IDEA
  * owncloud
      - I prefer to keep my files & notes under my control
      - works also across devices
  * git
  * Neuland Markers
      - For drawing flipcharts
  * reveal.js
