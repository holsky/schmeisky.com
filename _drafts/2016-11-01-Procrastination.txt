What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.


For a procrastinator, this is the opposite of the PhD-type situation, which I described as a catastrophic match for a procrasinator. Writing regularly with an immediate audience is an example of a terrific match for a procrastinator’s personality, because it puts his Panic Monster in the optimal location—it aligns the Panic Monster with his most important endeavor.

he’s actually spending a lot of time above the important line, so he has a conviction about the undertaking he didn’t previously.

“important tasks” as things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals.
