Educational systems in the US and Denmark are very different in the attention and money that is spend on disadvantaged children. [This study](http://ftp.iza.org/dp10000.pdf) ([summarizing article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/the-us-vs-denmark-is-the-scandinavian-model-best-for-social-mobility))<span title="The Scandinavian Fantasy: The Sources of Intergenerational Mobility in Denmark and the U.S."><sup><u>1</u></sup></span> investigated educational outcomes (degrees achieved) by children in both countries and surprisingly found an equally strong connection between the parents' education and childrens' educational achievement in both countries.

The key point of the study is that while danish children score higher on cognitive tests at age 15, the relationship between family influence and child education is as strong as in the US. This means that the extensive aid from an early age on does indeed improve childrens potential, but that the danish state fails to translate this into better educational outcomes. This means lowly educated parents are as likely to have lowly educated children as in the United States, where much less money and attention is spend on disadvantaged children. This is by no means obvious and runs contrary to what I thought of the danish school system before. 

So why is there no significant difference? The answer is in the higher incentives in the US to earn a higher degree, since basically without one your life will be much more uncomfortable than with one. In Denmark, this difference is much smaller, due to the high welfare levels and wage compression because of taxes and regulations. Another contributing factor is that also in Denmark, better-off parents tend to find ways to send their children to school with other children from better-off parents.

In the conclusions, the authors took a little shortcut (the paper is already 74 pages long) and simply suggest to combine the US feature of incentivizing educational attainment and the danish feature of promoting cognitive skills for the disadvantaged children.
