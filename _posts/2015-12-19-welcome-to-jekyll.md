This is my first Jekyll post.

Nice to play around with it!

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight elixir %}
def hello (name) do 
  IO.puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
hello('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
