## Build a Container in 20 minutes 

[This video is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPuvDm8IC-4) a walkthrough of starting to build a container system in a 20 minute talk, with an explanation of all the concepts involved (namespaces, hostname space/UTS, and a separate filesystem).

Of course it's not of practical use, but it's nice to get an idea how a container like Docker works. Here's the [finished code](https://gist.github.com/julz/c0017fa7a40de0543001) if you are impatient:

This [workshop](https://github.com/Fewbytes/rubber-docker) in Python goes even deeper with 10 levels to complete.

## Origins of Lisp

Lisp is that legendary language of fairy tales long lost. I found this [great article by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html) on the origins of Lisp. Apparently it was not devised as a programming language, but as a formal language in a research paper to come up with an alternative to the Turing Machine. Only later because on of his grad students tried to implement it, was it possible to run Lisp programs. This is why Lisp was not concerned with machine limitations of that time (like Fortran), but was more like pure math.

An interesting point Paul Graham makes is that many features Lisp already had in 1958 are only now getting fully adopted by modern languages, these being: Conditionals, Function Types, Recursion, Dynamic Typing, Garbage Collection, Programs composed of expressions, symbol types, the AST notation and Lisp's Metaprogramming facilities (that together make Lisp metaprogramming extremely powerful).

## Why it can be effective to use Lisp

This is [an article, by Matthew Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com/why-racket-why-lisp.html) who struggled with the definition of Lisp as the language of fairy tales and wonders by most of its proponents without explaining exactly *what* makes it so good. 

The reasons are in short: Everything as an expression, everything as a value or list brings high consistency, well-written documentation written mostly by CS professors, IDE ships with language, X-Expressions to represent XML-ish data, Scribble is a powerful templating language, syntax transformations in Racket itself and easy-to-define DSLs.

## Browser-based Presentations

[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) is a tool/library for browser-based presentations with nice transitions that will work everywhere a webbrowser works. Is not as hard to setup *well* as Prezi or impress.js.

## Practical Typography

[This online book about typography](http://practicaltypography.com/) helped me as a technical person to make sense of all the endless CSS Stylings and HTML tags to structure a page (like this one). The author offers reasonable advice on when to use which technique to style text (i.e. typography) based on the vast amounts of wisdom in the typographer's profession and adapts it to the modern web. The book is free to read, but I paid the author something to reward making this great resource.

## English Language

The English language has a larger vocabulary than other comparable European languages like French or German, maybe because English speakers have more fun to play around with foreign words and use them in their own language<span title="This is the short version of the reasoning in [The Mother Tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_Tongue)"><sup><u>1</u></sup></span>. For me, learning English will never top because of words like these:   

  * [Osssified](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ossify) - to turn into bone (literally), to become rigid in habits or to grow formulaic
  * [Paraphernalia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paraphernalia) - miscellaneous items you need to carry out a certain activity<span title="Digging deeper brings up an interesting root: In ancient greece paraphernalia were the things a woman brought into marriage, which unlike her dowry remained in her own possesion."><sup><u>2</u></sup></span>
  * [Apricity](http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/winter-words/apricity) - the warmth of the sun on a winter day
 

Digging deeper on apricity brings to light this interesting history: According to Merriam-Webster the word brought into English by Henry Cockeram in 1623 when he recorded (or possibly invented it) for his dictionary. However, it never really made it out of the dictionary into general use and is probably exemplary for the fate of English words that come only from single authors and not from general speech.
