## Build a Container in 20 minutes 

[This video is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPuvDm8IC-4) a walkthrough of starting to build a container system in a 20 minute talk, with an explanation of all the concepts involved (namespaces, hostname space/UTS, and a separate filesystem).

Of course it's not of practical use, but it's nice to get an idea how a container like Docker works. Here's the [finished code](https://gist.github.com/julz/c0017fa7a40de0543001) if you are impatient:

This [workshop](https://github.com/Fewbytes/rubber-docker) in Python goes even deeper with 10 levels to complete.

## Origins of Lisp

Lisp is that legendary language of fairy tales long lost. I found this [great article by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html) on the origins of Lisp. Apparently it was not devised as a programming language, but as a formal language in a research paper to come up with an alternative to the Turing Machine. Only later because on of his grad students tried to implement it, was it possible to run Lisp programs. This is why Lisp was not concerned with machine limitations of that time (like Fortran), but was more like pure math.

An interesting point Paul Graham makes is that many features Lisp already had in 1958 are only now getting fully adopted by modern languages, these being: Conditionals, Function Types, Recursion, Dynamic Typing, Garbage Collection, Programs composed of expressions, symbol types, the AST notation and Lisp's Metaprogramming facilities (that together make Lisp metraprogramming extremely powerful).

## Browser-based Presentations
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) is a tool/library for browser-based presentations with nice transitions that will work everywhere a webbrowser works. Is not as hard to setup *well* as Prezi or impress.js.


## Lambda Calculus
